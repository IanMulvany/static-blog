<div><br />        <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc">This<br /><br />article in Guardian</a> today is describing a method of restoring colour to<br /><br />some original BBC tv shows whose master tapes were wiped in a purge of the<br /><br />BBC archives.<br /><br />The shows were originally made in colour, then the master tapes were<br /><br />destroyed to make more room in the BBC archive, however black and white<br /><br />copies were made for distribution to countries which didn't have colour TV<br /><br />capability. The black and white versions were on a smaller format (16 mm)<br /><br />and of a lower resolution.</p><br /><br /><p>The method of recording was the following, the colour shows were displayed<br /><br />on a large screen and this was re-recorded onto the 16mm tape.</p><br /><br /><p>During this process owing to an artifact from the colour, on the black and<br /><br />white film there is a speckled fingeing error.</p><br /><br /><p>It describes this problem in the article as follows: &quot;However, there is a<br /><br />more relevant problem. Any black and white telerecording of a colour<br /><br />programme is prone to pick up interference from the colour encoded video<br /><br />signal. This manifests itself as a pattern of small grey dots, called<br /><br />chroma-dots, across the picture.&quot;</p><br /><br /><p>A filter used in the re-recording process could eliminate this error, but at<br /><br />the time of the recordings the error was considered so minor that often the<br /><br />filter was omitted. Back then TV was throwaway and space in a basement was<br /><br />considered more valuable than any idea of cultural heritage. Now we look<br /><br />back at the decision to scrap the original recordings as somwhat akin to the<br /><br />burning of the library of Alexandria. Storage, especially digital, is<br /><br />bountiful.</p><br /><br /><p>However, owing to what was then considered to be noise, an error, an<br /><br />imperfection in the process, James Insell has devised a technique to map<br /><br />back from these chroma-dots to the original colour. And so by looking at the<br /><br />finest structure of the current artifact through HD recordings of the 16mm<br /><br />film we can recapture  a state of the past that might have been lost to us.</p><br /><br /><p>Digging in the digital detritus has uncovered gold.</p><br /><br /><p>The formats of our cultural heritage are changing, and there is ever the<br /><br />danger that we might loose large chunks of our past when the ability read a<br /><br />certain format disappears. For specialist cases, such as the BBC archive,<br /><br />there will be, for some time to come, the likes of James Insell who will be<br /><br />willing to do the archeology needed to reconstruct from the remnants, but<br /><br />looking at the growing sprawl of media in my home I have a number of digital<br /><br />cards that can't be read any more, a zip drive that may or may not contain<br /><br />code from a summer of astrophysics, and some very personal movies on<br /><br />betamax, that lie in their boxes, becoming more tomb-like as the years roll<br /><br />by.</p><br /><br /><p>Aside from the personal onus to maintain my own history, I was really<br /><br />excited by this guardian article. I loved the idea of recovery from<br /><br />the minutia. It is an interesting example for the need for losses<br /><br />compression techniques.</p>   <p> <br />    <a href="http://partiallyattended.vox.com/library/post/digital-archeology-finding-traces-in-the-bits.html?_c=feed-atom-full#comments">Read and post comments</a>   |   <br />    <a href="http://www.vox.com/share/6a00d09e7c9248be2b00e398e3451b0004?_c=feed-atom-full">Send to a friend</a> <br /></p><br /><br />                </div>
